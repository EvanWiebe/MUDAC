# MUDAC
Midwest Undergraduate Data Science Competition (Mudac)

This project achieved third place in the Mudac competition, competing against 38 undergraduate teams. The goal was to analyze data to inform optimal factory placement.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Performed extensive data cleaning tasks including handling missing values and ensuring proper data storage for analysis.
* **Feature Analysis:** Analyzed key features using machine learning models like linear regression and lasso regression to identify factors important for optimal factory placement.
* **Prediction and Communication:** Utilized the findings from the analysis to make predictions and inform an oral presentation on the most suitable location for a new factory.
